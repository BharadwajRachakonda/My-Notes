# My Notes

If you have a repository in your GitHub and want to bring it to your local system

`git init`

`git remote add origin {url}`

`git pull origin main`

> check your current branch

`git branch`

> if its not in main run `git checkout -b main`

`git add .`

`git commit - 'initial commit'`

`git push origin main`
